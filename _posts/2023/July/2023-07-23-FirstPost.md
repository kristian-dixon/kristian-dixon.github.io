# First post of the new blog


First posts are kinda hard. I'm just going to skip the "about me" part since there's a place for that on the homepage and I’ll just make this post be about what this blog is and what it's for.


Over the past five or six years I've used Twitter as what I've called a "soft portfolio". In other words I was too lazy to keep up writing a blog after I was done with Uni so I decided to dump interesting looking gifs of my work on there as a placeholder. Recent events have made me doubt Twitter's longevity and also not being able to share things with non Twitter users basically makes it useless as a platform for me. As a result I've decided to move everything across to my own website.


I've built this website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a host and using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the blog’s posts. I went for the dark version of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme but modified things about it to suit my needs. This is the first web project I've worked on without an experienced web dev so I've tried to keep things simple for now but I'm pretty happy with what I've put together so far. In the future I want to add a section somewhere for live demos since I'm really excited about WebGPU and I quite enjoy playing with [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/). I've also got quite a bit of experience with [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) so I'd like to figure out integrating that into posts at some point too.


This blog will retain the "soft portfolio" approach that I used on Twitter but with a bit more actual content now that I'm not restricted by character limits. I'm purposely going to avoid being too formal with my posts as part of that. Whilst I'm used to writing formal documents as a part of my job, I don't think that style of writing is particularly fun for me to write or for other people to read, so I think it's best to write these posts like I'm writing a letter to a friend. I think keeping posts fun to write will mean that I'll actually keep up with maintaining the website instead of only thinking about it whenever I have to pay the domain fees.


The first batch of posts will be focused on talking about older projects. Outside of a technical report I wrote about six months ago, I've not done much writing lately so it'll be a good chance to brush off any skill rot that's set in before I get going with things that I'm actively looking at. It'll also let me reflect on the things I've achieved over the past few years; this is my other reason for building this space, I want to be able to inspire myself on the bad days.


I think my first *proper* post will be a recap of my RTX based dissertation that I've spent far too long putting off writing about. It's quite complex so I'll likely have to split it into multiple bits (oh god I hope that's not a pain in the arse in Jekyll) but it's probably one of the most important things I've ever worked on since it set me up for working life really well.

I'm not really sure how to sign these off so now I'll just do:


Thanks for reading and have a good rest of your day,
