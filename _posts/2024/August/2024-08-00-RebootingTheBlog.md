# Intro

Hello, for a long while I've wanted to get back into sharing the stuff I've been working on in my spare time. Previously I'd just used Twitter as a soft portfolio, but I've wanted to shift over to a more stable platform and this is essentially me doing that. My focus will largely be on graphics programming and game development but I will also occasionally deviate from that. 

I'm really hoping I can use this blog to show cool things off and hopefully inspire other people to do cool things too. Where I can I want to embed live demos, I'm quite interested in playing with things like WebGPU, and I really like websites with 3D models embedded in them so I want to try and do that too. 

I hope you enjoy reading the blog, thanks :)
