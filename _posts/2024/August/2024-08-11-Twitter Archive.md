# Twitter Post Archive

My main use for Twitter until it got ruined was as a sort of mini portfolio where I could post bits of things I'd been working on or experimenting with. This worked well but Twitter is no longer fit for this purpose as it's both inaccessible and not a positive place to be. As such I've ported all my posts to this page so that they don't just dissapear one day. Please note, to save your bandwidth I've set all videos to not preload but they should all play when interacted with.
